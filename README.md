# Restock
## Never run out of milk again
Restock is an app for Android and iOS that manages your grocery shopping ToDo list for you. Simply scan a product with a barcode using the app and it will automatically appear in your Wunderlist so you won't forget it next time.
For easier access, Restock supports iBeacons on iOS that will bring up the app when in e.g. the kitchen.

This project has been created for HackZurich 2015.
